   Most of the proposed approaches to Tomato plant diseases detection are based either on a small dataset or on PlantVillage dataset that contains unrealistic images. In this work we have used Convolutional neural networks with the images from PlantVillage dataset reaching an accuracy of 99.85\%, outperforming state-of-the-art results. Then our contribution is to overcome the problem of the dataset proposing a realistic and robust variation of it as the base for further tasks in tomato plant diseases recognition.
