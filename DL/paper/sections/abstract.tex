\begin{abstract}
   Most of the proposed approaches to Tomato plant diseases recognition are based either on a small dataset or on PlantVillage dataset which contains leaves images  on a table. In this work we use Convolutional Neural Networks trained on PlantVillage dataset reaching an accuracy of $99.85\%$, outperforming state-of-the-art results. Then our contribution is to overcome the dataset  limitations proposing a reasonable and robust variation of it having in mind a realistic deployment environment.
