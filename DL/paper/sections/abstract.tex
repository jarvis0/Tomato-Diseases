\begin{abstract}
   The ABSTRACT should be self contained and explain what the paper is about. Usually abstracts are no longer than 300 words. You should state what are the main contributions of your work and tempt the reader to continue to read your paper. A good abstract briefly describes your problem, approach, and key results. This document is based on the CVPR submission template, and it has been adapted to submit a technical report of a project of the Deep Learning and Image Classification course.
