\section{Introduction}
The advances of science and technology in history have given the possibility to produce enough food to meet the demand of more than 7 billion people. However, food provisioning is threatened by a number of factors such as climate change (Tai et al., 2014), the decline in pollinators (Report of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Science-PolicyPlatform on Biodiversity Ecosystem and Services on the work of its fourth session, 2016), plant diseases (Strange and Scott, 2005), and others. Thus, these factors cause direct impacts on the population, such as economic, health, and livelihood impacts \cite{AuthorsMasnzonis}. Plant diseases are not only a threat to food security at the global scale, but can also have disastrous consequences for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods depend on healthy crops. In the developing world, more than 80 percent of the agricultural production is generated by smallholder farmers (UNEP, 2013), and reports of yield loss of more than 50\% due to pests and diseases are common (Harvey et al., 2014). Furthermore, the largest fraction of hungry people (50\%) live in smallholder farming households (Sanchez and Swaminathan, 2005), making smallholder farmers a group that is particularly vulnerable to pathogen-derived disruptions in food supply.
Various efforts have been developed to prevent crop loss due to diseases based on pesticide usage. Independent of the approach, identifying a disease correctly when it first appears is a crucial step for effective and efficient disease management (Ehler, 2006).
\\Historically, disease identification has been supported by agricultural extension organizations or other institutions, such as local plant clinics that have provided expertise support on the field. In recently times, these efforts have been additionally supported by leveraging the increasing of Internet penetration worldwide with on-line diagnoses and the tools based on mobile phones, taking advantage of the rapid uptake of mobile phones technology in all parts of the world (ITU, 2015). These factors, combined together, lead to a situation where disease diagnosis based on automated image classification, if technically feasible, can be made available at an unprecedented scale.
\\On this line, our work focuses in the first place on a deep learning approach to the image classification task of ten tomato plant diseases (or healthy) using the PlantVillage dataset and secondly on the targeted sensitivity analysis of that data which has been used in state-of-the-art works about the task at hand. As first step we will reproduce the results of several related works achieving better performances. Then, we will visualize how the learned model responds to input images by using two techniques: GradCam and Occlusion. Finally, on that basis we will make a sensitivity analysis of the original dataset by building ad hoc variations of it that will, together with model visualization, give us insights on its actual robustness. These experiments will be pursued keeping in mind reasonable environments in which the prediction phase will be performed such as plantations, greenhouses, and so on.
